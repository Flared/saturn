#################
 Getting Started
#################

The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed at the newcomer to Saturn.
They're designed to help you get started quickly, and show how easy it is to work with
Saturn as a developer who wants to customise it and get it working according to their
own requirements.

These tutorials take you step-by-step through some key aspects of this work. They're not
intended to explain the :doc:`topics in depth </topics/index>`, or provide
:doc:`reference material </references/index>`, but they will leave you with a good idea
of what is possible to achieve in just a few steps, and how to go about it.

Once you're familiar with the basics presented in these tutorials, you'll find the more
in-depth coverage of the same topics in the :doc:`How-to </how_to/index>` section.

The tutorials follow a logical progression, starting from installation of Saturn and the
creation of simple pipeline, and build on each other, so it's recommended to work
through them in the order presented here.
